# Durable checkpoint

Handoff date: 2026-10-06. Active task: F01 foundation, single implementation writer.
Cloud task: `01a10f4b-596b-700b-b8ba-241e3ca2c000`.
Parent/source thread: `01a10e89-0c59-737a-8ede-620d02be2034`.
Parent owns sole continuation automation `6ac46da8df5881918271382eed68361e`:
hourly flexible schedule anchored 2026-10-06 03:40:24 UTC; skips active/uncertain
tasks, resumes idle checkpoint, stops at awaiting user playtest. No scheduler here.

## Initial reconciliation

Local branch `work` was unborn, no tracked/untracked user files. `git ls-remote
origin` returned no refs. Connected GitHub branches and PR searches returned empty.
Parent's independent read-only audit confirmed no commits, files, PRs, Actions
runs or rulesets; classic protection read was 403, not proven absent. No prior
instructions, `.agents/skills`, checkpoint or running implementation process found.
No relevant local missing skill reference to install. All three complete source
Pages read successfully and copied into docs with links and handoff date.

## Execution capability

Saved Cloud environment provides shell, Git, GCC, Make, Python. Initial environment
lacked ARM binutils, PNG development headers and emulator. Packages are being
extracted under /workspace/toolchain without changing system installation.
Git network reads work. `gh` GraphQL and REST reads return Forbidden; connected
GitHub tools successfully read branches/PRs. No Cloud submission/status tool is
exposed inside this worker; parent reconciles running Cloud tasks. Do not duplicate.

Upstream selected: `pret/pokeemerald` at
`731ad5bfd6e6f265508d0efcca0ba42f9dcf5881` (2026-10-01).
Compiler selected: `pret/agbcc` at `da598c1d918402c42c0c0d7128ba14567f3175e9`.
The upstream workflow has push/PR CI and symbol-branch writes, no schedule; preserve
its text as provenance but do not activate it in this repository.

## State

Implemented: handoff documentation bootstrap. Compiled: pending. Runtime verified:
pending. Merged: no. Base: empty repository; minimal docs main bootstrap needed
for ordinary scoped task PRs. Next: import exact stock engine on F01 branch,
finish matching toolchain, compile/compare and run emulator boot. No gameplay
work before the foundation gate. Stages 1–5 and improvement cycles not started.
